# My personal site
Welcome! Here's where I host the code for my personal site.

## My interests
If I could sum up my interests in a single phrase, it would be "creating virtual worlds". I'm always
interested in immersive virtual reality, human-like AI, game design, advanced graphics and
simulation techinques, procedural content generation, and all related fields.

In service of the above, I also dig all things related to the developer experience. To create
elaborate virtual worlds, we need sophisticated tools. The things I think developers need most in
the coming decade are automatic parallelization, unified CPU/GPU interfaces, elegant data
queries outside of traditional database contexts, and creative new modalities for editor and
productivity software.

I concern myself with the interplay between technology, society, and economy. Decentralization of
energy generation, computation, financial instruments, and social media are very important to my
vision of a better future.

Last, I will sometimes obsess over solutions to daily inconveniences. Usually with some kind of
arts, crafts, or home improvement.

## My list of interesting companies
### First Tier
- AMD (Chip design)
    - Currently trying to improve the appeal of their GPU's compared to NVIDIA, and so are doing a
    lot of open source work with GPU software stacks. I think this is valuable work.
- Intel (Chip design and manufacturing)
    - Same as AMD above.
- VRChat (VR Social Media)
    - The premier social media for a burgeoning VR platform. I would like to work there just to get
    deeper insights into the state of VR for the average user.
- Fluid Reality (VR Haptics)
    - A compelling technology for fingertip haptics. Would love to be on the cutting edge of this
    development. The company does not seem to be very organized.
- Bigscreen (VR Headsets and Software)
    - Leanest VR headset on the market. Compelling vision for the future of VR.
- Steam (Games and VR)
    - Refreshing corporate structure. They manufacture good VR headsets, and have many opportunties
    for software infrastructure for games and VR, which I would like to influence.
- HigherOrderCO (Automatic parallelization language)
    - A really compelling infrastructure for automatic parallelization of code with few limitations.
    Would love to contribute.
- Modular/Mojo (Language targetting CPU/GPU)
    - Elegant language with modern features and which also targets both CPU and GPU.
- Neuralink (Brain-computer interface)
    - The most advanced brain computer interface being developed. BCI is the eventual end-game of
    VR.
- Synchron (Brain-computer interface)
    - A less invasive BCI than Neuralink, with less potential data transfer capabilities but further
    in clinical trials.
- Science Corporation (Among others, brain-computer interfaces)
    - They have an open software developer position related to brain computer interfaces. Would love
    to get involved.
- Blender (3D graphics software)
    - Unlikely that they have open positions, but an open source graphics software position would
    be awesome!
- Imagination Technologies (GPU design)
    - They design some of the only RISC-V focused GPU's. Would like to contribute to their
    ecosystem.
- Qualcomm (Chip design)
    - They produce many of the chips in Meta's VR headsets, and other mobile solutions. They will
    probably have outsized impact on mobile computing.
- Clockwork Labs (In-memory game-oriented database)
    - I think database-oriented design needs more attention. Seems like a compelling system for
    games, would like to gain experience.
- SimulaVR (VR OS and headset)
    - The only real VR OS effort aside from Meta.
- Broadcom (Chip design)
    - A common single-board-computer GPU designer. I think the experience would be valuable as
    adjacent to mobile use cases.
- Weta FX (VFX)
    - Reputable VFX engineers, researchers, and artists.

### Second Tier
- Zed Industries (Zed editor)
    - Ground-up editor, with good first principles. Unfortunately not very experimental with design.
- NVIDIA (GPU design)
    - High performance chips and interesting software stacks for applying the hardware to problems.
    Unfortunately, I don't see a drive to innovate at the current NVIDIA.
- Epic Games (Game engine)
    - Advanced graphics stack and many content-generation oriented features, but I think the
    software stack has some noteable issues and tech-debt.
- Apple (Integrated hardware and software)
    - Interesting attempt with Apple Vision Pro. Unfortunately, I believe they are moving away from
    innovation with the Vision Pro after it flopped.
- Meta (Social media and VR)
    - I'm interested in the research labs with VR, but unfortunately they seem to redirecting
    resources away from VR towards AI these days, which I don't think will create them a lot of
    value in the long run.
- Lightmatter (Photonic computing)
    - There are few companies exploring photonic computing, even though I think the underlying
    physics of photonic computing seem very promising to me. Would like to be a part.
- Bluesky (Decentralized social media)
    - I think decentralized social media is important for future societal health. I would love to
    contribute to one of the leading efforts.
- CREAL (XR display techonology)
    - Adjustable-depth display projected onto glasses, which allows for mixed-reality. Interesting
    if it can be developed further.
- Minatec (Neuromorphic computing)
    - Internships available, techonological research group. Interested in the neuromorphic computing
    offer.
- Samsara Vision (Vision prosthesis)
    - Vision will probably be one of the hardest problems to tackle in BCI technology. I would like
    to explore existing visual prothesis technologies to see what the state-of-the-art is.
- Unity (Game engine)
    - Although ad-focused monetizations schemes have been disruptive to the community, I think Unity
    is improving in several key aspects by developing more advanced graphics pipelines and
    ECS-inspired systems.
- SideFX (VFX/simulation software)
    - One of the primier content generation software producers. Would like to gain experience there.
- Larian Studios (Game development)
    - A slow-paced but quality focused game development studio focusing on rich RPG experiences.
- Cascadeur (Animation software)
    - An intuitive animation editor which utilizes intelligent models to assist the process.
- Pimax (VR headset designer)
    - A high-quality and experimental headset designer. I feel like I would be rewarded for
    exploring there.
- Immersed VR (VR headset designer)
    - Designing a sleek headset that supposedly is releasing soon.
- Espressif (Single-board computers)
    - Another reputable and friendly company, with excellent Rust support for their chips.
- Palantir (Mixed reality opportunity)
    - A prestigious company/founder working on mixed reality. Good experience.
